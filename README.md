## Target audience

Before I start planning the wireframe , I need to clarify who we’re making our portfolio 
for, and what we want to communicate to them. Obviously there are two type of people who are likely to visit my portfolio website,

1. HR (Human Resources) hiring managers 
And 
2. developers


Our job will be to create a site that communicates our value to both groups of 
people. Generally, the first point of contact you’ll have is with an HR person. Unless I will apply to a very small startup company. They will reduce the number of candidates to 
something more manageable before scheduling interviews.

Hiring managers care about the experience, projects, education, skillset — And they’re also looking for people they’d enjoy 
working with and the personalty. So the about my story section matters to HR person. So I provide very straightforward short self Introduction and clean style in the banner section as the first glance.And I put About me section right underneath the homepage Introduction section. Each section doesn’t share the room with other section horizontally. 

On the homepage, the project section which developers most concern about positions right beneath the about me section. I don’t want to include all the section content on the homepage ,so I pick part of the content display on it to keep the page neat and attach links to corresponding page for both about and project sections.
